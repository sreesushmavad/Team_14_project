A plot visualization displays the frequency of collisions during the selected time period using scatterplot markers on a map.
Top Cities with Highest Rate of Collisions
Users can select the affected people type (Pedestrians, Cyclists, or Motorists) using a selectbox input.
The top 10 cities in the United States with the highest rate of collisions for the selected affected people type are displayed.
